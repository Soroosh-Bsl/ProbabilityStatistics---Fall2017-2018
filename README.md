# ProbabilityStatistics---Fall2017-2018
The Engineering Probability &amp; Statistics course @ Sharif University of Technology ---Fall2017-2018

HW2: Implementing random number sequence generators in R. Linear congruential generator and midsquare method are implemented.

HW3: Employed ggplot2 to visualize random variables described in the problem.

HW4: Worked on a dataset of IMDB movies information. Extracted important features and other possible information such as covariance matrix.

HW5: Calculated and visualized the information in a sample data on Heterochromatin in cells.

HW6: Worked on a datset of general math scores of a university. Used maximum likelihood and various plots (e.g. boxplots) to obtain the required information.

Project1: Worked on obtaining a real-world online password through different scenarios. In phase 1, in Java, attempting a brute-force attack is implemented. In phase 2, the statistics of the attempts were analyzed.

Project2: Many distributions were implemnted in R language in a way that one can get random numbers from those distributions via setting the hyperparameters. A graphical interface was also implemented in R.
